Just a simple nodejs discord bot that gives you fortnite stats and does nothing else

If you want to run it on your local machine follow these Instructions
1) Install nodejs on the machine your running it on
2) Get an api key from here https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api
3) Create a discord bot user here https://discordapp.com/developers Note: if you don't know how to do this please look it up on youtube / google
4) Once you got both api keys but them both in the config.json under the right tag ( If you don't, The bot wont work.)
5) Navigate to the folder then open a command prompt or git bash and type "npm install" Note: this might take a few seconds
6) Type " node app.js " in the cmd / git bash
7) If theres no errors, Your gonna wanna take your bot's ( this is also on the discord.com/developers ) client_id then edit this link https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=client_id&scope=bot and put your client_id in where it says Client_id
8) Test it out!

Prefix : $
Note : Prefix is currently not changable since I don't think its necessary on such a simple bot, 
I might add this feature in the future.

Commands :
$lfstats {epicusername} {pc, xbl, psn}
Maybe more in the feature.
