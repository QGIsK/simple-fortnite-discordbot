Just a simple nodejs discord bot that gives you fortnite stats and does nothing else

Instructions:
1) Install nodejs on the machine your running it on
2) Navigate to the folder then open a command prompt or git bash and type "npm install" Note this might take a few seconds
3) Type " node app.js " in the cmd / git bash
4) Add it to your server by clicking on this link https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=433996474456473600&scope=bot
5) Test it out!

Prefix : $
Note : Prefix is currently not changable since I don't think its necessary on such a simple bot, 
I might add this feature in the future.

Commands :
$lfstats {epicusername} {pc, xbl, psn}
Maybe more in the feature.
